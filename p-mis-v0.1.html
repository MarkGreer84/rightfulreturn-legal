  <h2>📢 Public Misunderstanding Risk Disclosure</h2>

  <h3>⚖️ Common Misunderstandings — Let’s Clear Them Up</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>“Is this a tax shelter?”</strong> – No. Rightful Return is not, and never has been, structured for tax avoidance or evasion.</li>
    <li><strong>“Is this a scam?”</strong> – Absolutely not. Rightful Return is a lawful, educational PMA. Every member signs a contract and is offered a 48-hour review period with legal counsel before joining.</li>
    <li><strong>“Is this legal advice?”</strong> – No. Rightful Return does not offer legal advice, nor act as a legal service provider.</li>
    <li><strong>“Is this a get-rich-quick scheme?”</strong> – No. Surplus funds recovery is a slow, procedural, document-heavy process. We teach that truth plainly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>📄 Why This Notice Exists</h3>
  <p>We’re often misunderstood — by family members, critics, social media users, and even some public agency reps. We receive questions that follow the same pattern repeatedly. Since Rightful Return is a one-man operation, this page was created to clarify core questions and protect our time.</p>
  <p>If you have questions, please email <a href="mailto:helpis@rightfulreturn.org">helpis@rightfulreturn.org</a>.</p>

  <h3>🗣️ On Free Speech and Personal Opinion</h3>
  <p>We fully support your right to speak freely — but not to misrepresent. PMA members do not speak for Rightful Return unless authorized.</p>
  <blockquote>
    A Right = Property + Responsibility<br>
    You own your body. You are responsible for the impact of your speech.
  </blockquote>

  <h3>📜 Misunderstandings Do Not Alter Contracts</h3>
  <p>A misreading of our materials does not void any signed PMA contract, process, or jurisdictional boundaries. Ignorance is not a legal defense to a private agreement.</p>

  <h3>🛠️ Dispute Resolution</h3>
  <p>We resolve misunderstandings privately. All communications should be directed to <a href="mailto:helpis@rightfulreturn.org">helpis@rightfulreturn.org</a> before public escalation or commentary.</p>

  <h3>📣 A Note To:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lawyers:</strong> Please read the PMA agreement before offering opinions. We are not subject to the BAR system.</li>
    <li><strong>Influencers & YouTubers:</strong> Please do not critique Rightful Return content without full reading. Fair use ≠ fair representation.</li>
    <li><strong>Watchdogs & Auditors:</strong> We are not a public agency or franchise. No public reporting jurisdiction applies.</li>
    <li><strong>Government Agents:</strong> You are bound by our <a href="/notice-to-government.html">Notice to Government Actors</a>. We operate under private contract and reject statutory jurisdiction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>⚖️ Final Thought</h3>
  <p>Just because something is unfamiliar doesn’t make it unlawful. Rightful Return PMA stands in peace, in transparency, and in private contract. We are not the system — we are the other side of the coin.</p>
